    Valid properties:
        connectgaps
            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
            values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `customdata`.
        dx
            Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
        dy
            Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.

            or dict with compatible properties
        fill
            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
            "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
            "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use
            with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy"
            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and
            "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and
            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
            like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the
            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the
            space between two traces if one completely encloses the
            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"
            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
            order.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
            toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Legendgrouptitle
            ` instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        line
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Line` instance

            or dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        mode
            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace.
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Selected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the y axis.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.

        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when

        fill
            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
            "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
            "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use
            with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy"
            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and
            "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and
            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
            like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the
            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the
            space between two traces if one completely encloses the
            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"
            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
            order.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc

            ` instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.

        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc

            instance or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:

            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the y axis.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.

        fill
            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
            "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
            "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use
            with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy"
            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and
            "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and
            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
            like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the
            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the
            space between two traces if one completely encloses the
            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"
            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
            order.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.

            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:

            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc

            ` instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.

        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        mode
            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace.

            instance or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the y axis.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.

            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
            values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `customdata`.
        dx
            Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
        dy
            Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.

            or dict with compatible properties
        fill
            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
            "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
            "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use
            with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy"
            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and
            "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and
            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
            like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the
            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the
            space between two traces if one completely encloses the
            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"
            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
            order.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.

        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
            toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Legendgrouptitle
            ` instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        line
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Line` instance

            or dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        mode
            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace.
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity

            instance or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the y axis.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.

    Valid properties:
        alignmentgroup
            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
            matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls
            whether bars compute their positional range dependently
            or independently.
        base
            Sets where the bar base is drawn (in position axis
            units). In "stack" or "relative" barmode, traces that
            set "base" will be excluded and drawn in "overlay" mode
            instead.
        basesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `base`.
        cliponaxis
            Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the
            subplot axes. To show the text nodes above axis lines
            and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer` and
            `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.
        constraintext
            Constrain the size of text inside or outside a bar to
            be no larger than the bar itself.
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

            dict with compatible properties
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel

        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. variables `value` and `label`. Anything
            contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the
            secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        insidetextanchor
            Determines if texts are kept at center or start/end
            points in `textposition` "inside" mode.
        insidetextfont
            Sets the font used for `text` lying inside the bar.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
            toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Legendgrouptitle`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        marker
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Marker` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
            legend item and on hover.
        offset
            Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position
            axis units). In "group" barmode, traces that set
            "offset" will be excluded and drawn in "overlay" mode
            instead.
        offsetgroup
            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
            same position coordinate will line up.
        offsetsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `offset`.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        orientation
            Sets the orientation of the bars. With "v" ("h"), the
            value of the each bar spans along the vertical
            (horizontal).
        outsidetextfont
            Sets the font used for `text` lying outside the bar.
        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Selected` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Stream` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textangle
            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
            bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick
            labels vertically. With "auto" the texts may
            automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size
            in bars.
        textfont
            Sets the font used for `text`.
        textposition
            Specifies the location of the `text`. "inside"
            positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated
            and scaled if needed). "outside" positions `text`
            outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless
            there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text
            gets pushed inside. "auto" tries to position `text`
            inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar
            is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If
            "none", no text appears.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. variables `value` and `label`.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Unselected` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        width
            Sets the bar width (in position axis units).
        widthsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `width`.
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the y axis.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.

        fill
            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
            "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
            "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use
            with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy"
            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and
            "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and
            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
            like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the
            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the
            space between two traces if one completely encloses the
            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"
            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
            order.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

            `ids`.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
            toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Legendgrouptitle
            ` instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        line
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Line` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        marker
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Marker` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        mode
            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace.
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity

        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Selected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the y axis.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.

            whether bars compute their positional range dependently
            or independently.
        autobinx
            Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
            determined separately and `autobinx` is not needed.
            However, we accept `autobinx: true` or `false` and will
            update `xbins` accordingly before deleting `autobinx`
            from the trace.

        bingroup
            Set a group of histogram traces which will have
            compatible bin settings. Note that traces on the same
            subplot and with the same "orientation" under `barmode`
            "stack", "relative" and "group" are forced into the
            same bingroup, Using `bingroup`, traces under `barmode`
            "overlay" and on different axes (of the same axis type)
            can have compatible bin settings. Note that histogram
            and histogram2d* trace can share the same `bingroup`
        cliponaxis
            Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the

            and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer` and
            `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.
        constraintext
            Constrain the size of text inside or outside a bar to
            be no larger than the bar itself.

            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Cumulative`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements

            or dict with compatible properties
        histfunc
            Specifies the binning function used for this histogram
            trace. If "count", the histogram values are computed by
            counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If
            "sum", "avg", "min", "max", the histogram values are
            computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the
            maximum of the values lying inside each bin
            respectively.
        histnorm
            Specifies the type of normalization used for this
            histogram trace. If "", the span of each bar
            corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the
            number of data points lying inside the bins). If
            "percent" / "probability", the span of each bar
            corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences
            with respect to the total number of sample points
            (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If
            "density", the span of each bar corresponds to the
            number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of
            the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals
            the total number of sample points). If *probability
            density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the
            probability that an event will fall into the
            corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS
            equals 1).
        hoverinfo

            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".

            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        name

            legend item and on hover.
        nbinsx
            Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
            value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
            optimal bin size such that the histogram best
            visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
            `xbins.size` is provided.
        nbinsy
            Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
            value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
            optimal bin size such that the histogram best
            visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
            `ybins.size` is provided.
        offsetgroup
            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
            same position coordinate will line up.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        orientation
            Sets the orientation of the bars. With "v" ("h"), the
            value of the each bar spans along the vertical
            (horizontal).

        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets hover text elements associated with each bar. If a
            single string, the same string appears over all bars.
            If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to
            the this trace's coordinates.
        textangle
            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
            bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick
            labels vertically. With "auto" the texts may
            automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size
            in bars.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Specifies the location of the `text`. "inside"
            positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated
            and scaled if needed). "outside" positions `text`
            outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless
            there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text
            gets pushed inside. "auto" tries to position `text`
            inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar
            is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If
            "none", no text appears.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. variables `label` and `value`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the sample data to be binned on the x axis.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.

            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-

            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the sample data to be binned on the y axis.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.

        fill
            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
            "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
            "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use
            with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy"
            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and
            "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and
            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
            like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the
            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the
            space between two traces if one completely encloses the
            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"
            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
            order.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.

            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".

            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
            toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Legendgrouptitle
            ` instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        line

            or dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        mode
            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace.
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Selected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the y axis.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.

        cliponaxis
            Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
            clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
            text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
            to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below

        connectgaps
            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
            values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements

        fill
            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
            "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
            "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use
            with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy"
            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and
            "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and
            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
            like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the
            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the
            space between two traces if one completely encloses the
            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"
            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
            order.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        fillpattern
            Sets the pattern within the marker.
        groupnorm
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of
            this `stackgroup`. With "fraction", the value of each
            trace at each location is divided by the sum of all
            trace values at that location. "percent" is the same
            but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are
            multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one
            subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hoveron
            Do the hover effects highlight individual points
            (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
            regions? If the fill is "toself" or "tonext" and there
            are no markers or text, then the default is "fills",
            otherwise it is "points".
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.

            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
            toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Legendgrouptitle`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        line
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Line` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        marker
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Marker` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        mode
            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
            the provided `mode` includes "text" then the `text`
            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
            is "lines+markers". Otherwise, "lines".
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        orientation
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `orientation` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Sets the stacking direction. With "v"
            ("h"), the y (x) values of subsequent traces are added.
            Also affects the default value of `fill`.
        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Selected` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stackgaps
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at
            which other traces in this group have data but this one
            does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these
            locations. With "interpolate" we linearly interpolate
            between existing values, and extrapolate a constant
            beyond the existing values.
        stackgroup
            Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the
            same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or
            their x values if `orientation` is "h"). If blank or
            omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also
            turns `fill` on by default, using "tonexty" ("tonextx")
            if `orientation` is "h" ("v") and sets the default
            `mode` to "lines" irrespective of point count. You can
            only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in
            a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)
            other traces in the same group. With multiple
            `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if
            fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the
            later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the y axis.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.

    Valid properties:
        cliponaxis
            Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
            clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
            text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
            to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below

        connectgaps
            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
            values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements

        fill
            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
            "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
            "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use
            with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy"
            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and
            "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and
            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
            like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the
            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the
            space between two traces if one completely encloses the
            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"
            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
            order.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        fillpattern
            Sets the pattern within the marker.
        groupnorm
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of
            this `stackgroup`. With "fraction", the value of each
            trace at each location is divided by the sum of all
            trace values at that location. "percent" is the same
            but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are
            multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one
            subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hoveron
            Do the hover effects highlight individual points
            (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
            regions? If the fill is "toself" or "tonext" and there
            are no markers or text, then the default is "fills",
            otherwise it is "points".
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
            toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Legendgrouptitle`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        line
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Line` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        marker
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Marker` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        mode
            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
            the provided `mode` includes "text" then the `text`
            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
            is "lines+markers". Otherwise, "lines".
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        orientation
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `orientation` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Sets the stacking direction. With "v"
            ("h"), the y (x) values of subsequent traces are added.
            Also affects the default value of `fill`.
        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Selected` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stackgaps
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at
            which other traces in this group have data but this one
            does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these
            locations. With "interpolate" we linearly interpolate
            between existing values, and extrapolate a constant
            beyond the existing values.
        stackgroup
            Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the
            same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or
            their x values if `orientation` is "h"). If blank or
            omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also
            turns `fill` on by default, using "tonexty" ("tonextx")
            if `orientation` is "h" ("v") and sets the default
            `mode` to "lines" irrespective of point count. You can
            only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in
            a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)
            other traces in the same group. With multiple
            `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if
            fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the
            later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the y axis.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.

    Valid properties:
        cliponaxis
            Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
            clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
            text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
            to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below

        connectgaps
            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
            values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements

        fill
            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
            "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
            "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use
            with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy"
            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and
            "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and
            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
            like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the
            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the
            space between two traces if one completely encloses the
            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"
            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
            order.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        fillpattern
            Sets the pattern within the marker.
        groupnorm
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of
            this `stackgroup`. With "fraction", the value of each
            trace at each location is divided by the sum of all
            trace values at that location. "percent" is the same
            but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are
            multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one
            subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hoveron
            Do the hover effects highlight individual points
            (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
            regions? If the fill is "toself" or "tonext" and there
            are no markers or text, then the default is "fills",
            otherwise it is "points".
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
            toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Legendgrouptitle`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        line
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Line` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        marker
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Marker` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        mode
            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
            the provided `mode` includes "text" then the `text`
            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
            is "lines+markers". Otherwise, "lines".
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        orientation
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `orientation` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Sets the stacking direction. With "v"
            ("h"), the y (x) values of subsequent traces are added.
            Also affects the default value of `fill`.
        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Selected` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stackgaps
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at
            which other traces in this group have data but this one
            does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these
            locations. With "interpolate" we linearly interpolate
            between existing values, and extrapolate a constant
            beyond the existing values.
        stackgroup
            Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the
            same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or
            their x values if `orientation` is "h"). If blank or
            omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also
            turns `fill` on by default, using "tonexty" ("tonextx")
            if `orientation` is "h" ("v") and sets the default
            `mode` to "lines" irrespective of point count. You can
            only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in
            a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)
            other traces in the same group. With multiple
            `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if
            fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the
            later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the y axis.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.

            "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use
            with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy"
            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and
            "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and
            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
            like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the
            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the
            space between two traces if one completely encloses the
            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"
            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
            order.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        fillpattern
            Sets the pattern within the marker.
        groupnorm
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of
            this `stackgroup`. With "fraction", the value of each
            trace at each location is divided by the sum of all
            trace values at that location. "percent" is the same
            but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are
            multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one
            subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hoveron
            Do the hover effects highlight individual points
            (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
            regions? If the fill is "toself" or "tonext" and there
            are no markers or text, then the default is "fills",
            otherwise it is "points".
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
            toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Legendgrouptitle`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        line
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Line` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        marker
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Marker` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        mode
            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
            the provided `mode` includes "text" then the `text`
            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
            is "lines+markers". Otherwise, "lines".
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        orientation
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `orientation` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Sets the stacking direction. With "v"
            ("h"), the y (x) values of subsequent traces are added.
            Also affects the default value of `fill`.
        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Selected` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stackgaps
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at
            which other traces in this group have data but this one
            does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these
            locations. With "interpolate" we linearly interpolate
            between existing values, and extrapolate a constant
            beyond the existing values.
        stackgroup
            Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the
            same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or
            their x values if `orientation` is "h"). If blank or
            omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also
            turns `fill` on by default, using "tonexty" ("tonextx")
            if `orientation` is "h" ("v") and sets the default
            `mode` to "lines" irrespective of point count. You can
            only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in
            a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)
            other traces in the same group. With multiple
            `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if
            fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the
            later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the

    Valid properties:
        cliponaxis
            Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
            clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
            text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
            to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below
            traces*.
        connectgaps
            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
            values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for

        dx
            Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
        dy
            Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.

        fill
            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
            "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
            "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use
            with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy"
            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and
            "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and
            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
            like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the
            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the
            space between two traces if one completely encloses the
            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"
            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
            order.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        fillpattern
            Sets the pattern within the marker.
        groupnorm
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of
            this `stackgroup`. With "fraction", the value of each
            trace at each location is divided by the sum of all
            trace values at that location. "percent" is the same
            but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are
            multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one
            subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hoveron
            Do the hover effects highlight individual points
            (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
            regions? If the fill is "toself" or "tonext" and there
            are no markers or text, then the default is "fills",
            otherwise it is "points".
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
            toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Legendgrouptitle`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        line
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Line` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        marker
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Marker` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        mode
            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
            the provided `mode` includes "text" then the `text`
            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
            is "lines+markers". Otherwise, "lines".
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        orientation
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `orientation` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Sets the stacking direction. With "v"
            ("h"), the y (x) values of subsequent traces are added.
            Also affects the default value of `fill`.
        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Selected` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stackgaps
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not
            if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at
            which other traces in this group have data but this one
            does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these
            locations. With "interpolate" we linearly interpolate
            between existing values, and extrapolate a constant
            beyond the existing values.
        stackgroup
            Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the
            same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or
            their x values if `orientation` is "h"). If blank or
            omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also
            turns `fill` on by default, using "tonexty" ("tonextx")
            if `orientation` is "h" ("v") and sets the default
            `mode` to "lines" irrespective of point count. You can
            only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in
            a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)
            other traces in the same group. With multiple
            `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if
            fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the
            later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the y axis.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.
